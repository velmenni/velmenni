# Possible Improvements after Competitions

## At McMath, 2012-12-01

- Improve drive system: at the moment, it can barely move over sacks, and gets stuck frequently. It also has a tendency to wear down the clutches like there's no tomorrow.
- New pick up system: our current one sucks. Ugh.
- Better autonomous. We broke it.
- To win a competition.
